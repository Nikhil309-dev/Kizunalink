//! Process-wide rustls crypto provider selection.
//!
//! Feature unification leaves **both** `ring` and `aws-lc-rs` enabled in this
//! dependency graph: our workspace pins `ring`, while `reqwest`/`hyper-rustls`
//! opt into `aws-lc-rs` through their defaults. When rustls cannot resolve
//! exactly one provider from crate features it refuses to guess, and *every*
//! TLS handshake panics with:
//!
//! ```text
//! Could not automatically determine the process-level CryptoProvider from
//! Rustls crate features.
//! ```
//!
//! That failure is easy to miss because it happens on a spawned task: the voice
//! gateway's WebSocket connect dies while the player keeps reporting progress,
//! so the node looks alive but never sends a single audio packet.
//!
//! Installing the provider once, explicitly, makes handshakes deterministic.
//! `main()` calls this before building the runtime; the voice gateway also calls
//! it lazily so the library stays correct when embedded in another binary.
